<!-- 
The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:
    1. href specifies the path to the CSS file.
    2. The type  attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
    3. rel specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking 
       to a CSS file.
