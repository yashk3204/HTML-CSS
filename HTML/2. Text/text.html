        <!-- Headings -->
        <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
        <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
        <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>

        <!-- Paragraphs -->
        <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
        line.</p>
        <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
        into units of text. For example, a book may have
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.</p>
