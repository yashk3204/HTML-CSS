<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

1. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) 
   Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
2. Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are
   made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
3. Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. This contains information about the page (rather than information 
   that is shown within the main part of the browser window). 
4. Anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.
5. You may know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create 
   links that allow visitors to move from one page to another quickly and easily. A markup language allows you to annotate text, and 
   these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. If you think of a web page, we add code around the 
   original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the 
   markup.
